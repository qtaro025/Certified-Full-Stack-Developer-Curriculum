/**
 * Array Destructuring:
 * Array destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to
 * extract values from arrays and assign them to variables in a more
 * concise and readable way. It provides a convenient syntax for
 * unpacking array elements into distinct variables.
 */
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let [first, second, third] = fruits;
console.log(first); // "apple"
console.log(second); // "banana"
console.log(third); // "orange"

/**
 * Array destructuring also allows you to skip elements you're not
 * interested in by using commas.
 */
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"];
let [firstColor, , thirdColor] = colors;
console.log(firstColor); // Output: "red"
console.log(thirdColor); // Output: "blue"

/**
 * Another powerful feature of array destructuring is the ability to
 * use default values. If the array has fewer elements than the
 * variables you're trying to assign, you can provide default values:
 */
let numbers = [1, 2];
let [a, b, c = 3] = numbers;
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
console.log(c); // 3

/**
 * The rest syntax, denoted by three dots (...). It allows you to capture
 * the remaining elements of an array that havenâ€™t been destructured
 * into a new array.
 */
let fruits2 = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango", "kiwi"];
let [first2, second2, ...rest] = fruits;

console.log(first2); // "apple"
console.log(second2); // "banana"
console.log(rest); // ["orange", "mango", "kiwi"]
