/**
 * Debug Type Coercion Errors in a Buggy App
 * -----------------------------------------
 * You've just joined a local web development shop, and your first assignment is
 * to clean up some buggy code left behind by the previous developers.
 * They were attempting simple arithmetic operations, but something went wrong,
 * the results don't make sense. Your task is to review, debug, and correct the
 * code so it performs as expected and is easier to read.
 *
 * Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
 *
 * User Stories:
 *
 * 1. You should have a variable named firstResult that correctly adds the
 *      numbers 5 and 10 to produce the value 15.
 * 2. You should have a variable named secondResult that correctly subtracts
 *      5 from 8 to produce the value 3.
 * 3. You should have a variable named thirdResult that produces the value 6 by adding two numbers.
 *      Replace the boolean currently used in the expression with a number.
 * 4. You should have a variable named fourthResult that produces the value
 *      8 by adding two numbers. Replace the boolean currently used in the expression
 *      with a number.
 * 5. You should have a variable named fifthResult that correctly multiplies two numbers
 *      to get the product 20. Replace the string currently used in the expression with a number.
 * 6. You should have a variable named sixthResult that correctly adds two numbers to produce the
 *      value 22. Replace the null currently used in the expression with a number.
