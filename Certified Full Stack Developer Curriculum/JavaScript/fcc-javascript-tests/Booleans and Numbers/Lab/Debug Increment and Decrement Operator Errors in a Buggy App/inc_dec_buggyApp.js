/**
 * Debug Increment and Decrement Operator Errors in a Buggy App
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Your friend has asked you to help them debug their code. They
 * are practicing increment and decrement operators but are getting
 * unexpected results in the console.
 *
 * Your task is to help them identify the mistakes and update the code
 * so that the console outputs match the expected results.
 *
 * You can refer back to the prior lessons on increment and decrement
 * operators as well as prefix and postfix notation.
 *
 * User Stories:
 * -------------
 * 1. You should have a variable named updatedCounter that correctly produces
 *      the value 11 by using the increment operator. Update the expression to use the correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.
 * 2. You should have a variable named finalScore that correctly produces the value 8 by using the increment operator. Update the expression to use the
 *      correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.
 * 3. You should have a variable named updatedCoins that correctly produces the value 2 by using the decrement operator. Update the expression to use the
 *      correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.
 * 4. You should have a variable named newHealth that correctly produces the value 7 by using the decrement operator. Update the expression to use the
 *      correct prefix or postfix notation instead of hardcoding the value.
