        <h2>Transcript</h2>
        <p>
          [MUSIC] So this week we're going to talk
          about the importance of testing. When people first start
          out in computer science, they typically do not like the test. All right, they find the process of
          thinking about their programs and how to design them and how to actually
          implement them to be much more fun and interesting and exciting than testing. But, I would like to point out that
          testing is sort of an integral part of this process. Okay, that if you think carefully about
          how you're going to test your program it actually makes the development of
          your program much, much easier, because you've thought carefully
          about sort of the corner cases and the things that your
          program should actually do. So the point here that we're trying to
          make is that testing is an important and interesting part, and it does allow for you to think
          carefully about what you're doing. I'd like to let give us a nice example
          here of a how testing is valuable. >> So actually,
          I don't do any testing stunts. >> [LAUGH]. >> I'm in this video just for
          the looks here. >> [LAUGH].
          >> Just to balance while we're sitting here. >> [LAUGH]. >> But more seriously, actually,
          after that 10 year break from programming, from writing programs, in the last two or three days I had the pleasure
          of writing code again. And it was through
          testing that I understood the actual details of the algorithm. So I, we were trying to get
          algorithm to work, and we try. Every time we try a few test cases,
          things would work. But then we run into the next
          test case and it will fail. And it was impossible to
          get the code working, except through extensive
          testing of the code. >> All right, so they're really, there's
          kind of two strategies for testing. One is, you can be like Scott and
          just never write any erroneous code. Just no bugs,
          perfect the first time through. >> That seems the best way. >> [LAUGH] Unfortunately, I don't think
          we can all teach you to be like Scott. [LAUGH] However there's a second approach,
          and I want to say a little bit about my experience in teaching
          students to program. I teach and on campus version of an intro
          to programming class, and i also teach introduction to interactive programming
          in Python, and we've run through five sessions now, and in those sessions
          I've seen lots and lots of bad code. And probably the worst case that I
          see is when a student is working on a mini-project and they go and
          they essentially write the entire program. They take it and they then say, hit Run. And they have their fingers crossed, and
          they're hoping they're like Scott and it's all going to run. >> [LAUGH]
          >> Except then they're severely disappointed
          because, bam, an error comes up So they heroically go through their 50 lines,
          and they look for that error. And then they finally find it and
          they fix it. And they hit Run again, and
          another error comes up. And after they're found
          about the seventh or eighth errors they start
          to get frustrated. Because it's really hard to find
          those errors in a 50-line program. And so the best piece of advice I
          have about testing is the following. Don't write your code and then test. Write a little bit of code. Test. Write a little bit of code. Test. Write a little bit of code. Test. That will keep the pain of testing down
          at a much more tractable level because if your program is working and
          you write a couple of lines of code and then a test fails,
          you know where the failure is. It's in that few lines
          that you've written. Now you might think, wow with all this
          testing its going to take me lots of time. But remember, if you test as you go,
          what you'll see is, that the time you spend on finding
          those errors is really reduced. And so at the end of the day,
          testing will save you time. >> I think that's an excellent point here,
          and I think that in this class we want to take the philosophy where, were going to
          ease you into testing, that were going to provide you with a bunch of tests
          that you can run on your own. And that will help you sort of to solidify
          whether or not your program's actually working and hopefully help you
          to debug your program as you go. But we also want you to spend the time to
          think about writing tests on your own and so we're going to provide you with
          some infrastructure to help you do that as well. And so hopefully between these two, sort of, testing methodologies, we'll help
          ease you into the process of testing and convince you that what
          we're saying is correct. The testing is just as
          important as writing your code. And that testing is something that should
          go on in parallel with writing your code, not something you just do at the end.
