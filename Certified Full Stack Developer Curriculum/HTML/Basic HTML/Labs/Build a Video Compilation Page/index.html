      <h1>Fundamentals of Computing Specialization (Rice University)</h1>
      <p>
        This Specialization covers much of the material that first-year Computer
        Science students take at Rice University, brought to you by the
        <a
          href="https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mcs/faculty"
          >world-class Faculty</a
        >
        who teach our
        <a href="https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/online-mcs"
          >master's</a
        >
        and PhD programs. Students learn sophisticated programming skills in
        Python from the ground up and apply these skills in building more than
        20 fun projects. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone exam that
        allows the students to demonstrate the range of knowledge that they have
        acquired in the Specialization.

        <h2>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)</h2>
        <p>
          In Part 1 of this course, we will introduce the basic elements of
          programming (such as expressions, conditionals, and functions) and
          then use these elements to create simple interactive applications such
          as a digital stopwatch. Part 1 of this class will culminate in
          building a version of the classic arcade game "Pong"

        <h2>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)</h2>
        <p>
          In Part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of
          programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these
          elements to create games such as Blackjack. Part 2 of this class will
          culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game
          "Asteroids".

        <h2>Principles of Computing (Part 1)</h2>
        <p>
          In part 1 of this course, the programming aspect of the class will
          focus on coding standards and testing. The mathematical portion of the
          class will focus on probability, combinatorics, and counting with an
          eye towards practical applications of these concepts in Computer
          Science.
